# About me

I am a passionate security researcher focusing on macOS and iOS platforms.

My interests include:
- Reverse engineering Apple system components
- Exploring macOS/iOS internals and frameworks
- Investigating vulnerabilities and developing proof-of-concepts
- Studying XPC, Mach IPC, sandbox, and kernel security

I continuously learn and improve my skills in low-level exploitation and vulnerability research on Apple platforms.

Feel free to connect or collaborate on security research related to macOS and iOS.
